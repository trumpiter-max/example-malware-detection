## Scope

Our project to use simple machine and deep learning model to classify malware then detect their family.

## Model

The model of this project is stored at [here](/notebook/).

## Limitation

In this technique, we only use static analysis to clasify malwar, and some binary file is not unpacked so the result seems is not always correct as our expectation.

## Get started

To run application, make sure all library is installed (recommended install this project on UNIX/LINUX system) with:

```sh
    pip install -r ./app/requirements.txt
```

Then, make everything work:

```
    python3 ./app/run.py
```


## Demo how to use

In this scenario, we introduce how to use the application with example malware.
